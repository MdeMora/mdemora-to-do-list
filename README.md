# Hello!/ Hola! 

This project has been bootstrapped from my own source repository MdeMora-Skeleton

I hope you enjoy this project. It showcases a To-do List created with the latest technologies:

Material UI v5 / emotion with an a styled components approach
React Hook Form v7 & Yup validation
Firestore Web v9
Redux & Thunks with a duck structure



# MdeMora-Skeleton

I've created this template to reuse my own code setup. Feel free to use it!

Make sure to add the `NODE_PATH=src/` to the .env to make this work

This skeleton uses Material UI v5 with emotion styling
